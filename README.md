### Hey!

🔭 I'm looking for a PhD position in AIoT or related fields.       
💬 About me:
- A die-hard Harry Potter fan. My favorite characters are Ron Weasley and Regulus Black. Those who show bravery always deeply touch me. By the way, we might argue if you're a Draco fan. :-)
- 一个很严格的“的/地/得”和“不以为意/不以为然”小警察. 
- I firmly believe that courage, curiosity, perseverance, and working with exceptional people are the most important things.

📫Feel free to contact me. I've placed a link on the left where I've written some blogs.
